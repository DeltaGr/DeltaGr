|**Front-End:** <br/>🌐 HTML + CSS + JavaScript + React| I build clean, structured layouts that are a joy to navigate. Playing with Flexbox, grid and building pixel-perfect layouts that follow patterns such as responsiveness and modular design. |
| **Back-End:** <br/> ⚙️ Node.js + Ruby on Rails + MongoDB | Structuring APIs and databases to make sure data flows like clockwork, where every part has its place in the system. |
| **Version Control:** <br/> Github (always) |  Keeping everything in check, organized, and on track, like branches in a tree. 🌳 |
| **Design:** <br/> UI / UX |  Designing UI patterns and UX flows that prioritize user needs and create smooth journeys. |
| **Artistic Eye:** <br/>| I know how to make things pretty, and functional too! |

🌍 Remote = My ideal habitat

📍 Open to Relocation (I match with your team? Let's chat!)<br>

Currently job-hunting and excited to join a team that values my unique approach to problem-solving. 
Ready to build the future, one line of code at a time. Let’s make magic happen! ✨

 🔭 I’m currently working on **new projects**<br>
 🌱 I’m currently learning **Python**<br>

 💡 Always Curious – I’m constantly learning and evolving, bringing new ideas and a unique perspective to everything I do. I love building systems that are efficient, logical, and visually appealing.
<br><br>
 🧠  My brain loves logic, and structure. I dive deep into patterns, systems, and problem-solving. I’m drawn to the systems, cycles, and grids that drive good code. Everything has its place—like components, loops, and functions that fit together seamlessly. Think of me as a precision artist, but instead of a paintbrush, I wield JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.
