**🔬 Junior Full Stack Web Developer | Artistic Mind, Architect of Patterns & Code** 🌠

Graduated and full of ideas – now I’m here to experiment and push the boundaries of what code can do and to tackle the web development universe! 
I’m a full stack developer with a background in art and design, constantly exploring new ways to blend creativity with cutting-edge technology.

I’m a developer who loves discovering patterns in everything. From clean code to design aesthetics, I’m passionate about creating applications that follow a logical flow. I bring my artistic background into the world of code by crafting smooth, organized structures.

|**Front-End:** <br/>🌐 HTML + CSS + JavaScript + React| I build clean, structured layouts that are a joy to navigate. Patterns like flexbox, grid and building pixel-perfect layouts that follow patterns such as responsiveness and modular design. 🔶📏 |
| **Back-End:** <br/> ⚙️ Node.js + Ruby on Rails + MongoDB | Structuring APIs and databases to make sure data flows like clockwork, where every part has its place in the system. 🔗📊 |
| **Version Control:** <br/> Github (always) |  Keeping everything in check, organized, and on track, like branches in a tree. 🌳 |
| **Design:** <br/> UI / UX | 🎨 Designing UI patterns and UX flows that prioritize user needs and create smooth journeys. 🟣💡 |
| **Artistic Eye:** <br/>| I know how to make things pretty, and functional too! 🎨 |

🌍 Remote = My ideal habitat

📍 Open to Relocation (Pattern matches with your team? I’m there!)<br>

Currently job-hunting and excited to join a team that values my unique approach to problem-solving. Let's create something amazing together!
Ready to build the future, one line of code at a time. Let’s make magic happen! ✨

 🔭 I’m currently working on **new projects**
 🌱 I’m currently learning **Python**

 💡 Always Curious – I’m constantly learning and evolving, bringing new ideas and a unique perspective to everything I do. I love building systems that are efficient, logical, and visually appealing.

 🧠  My brain loves logic, and structure. I dive deep into patterns, systems, and problem-solving. I’m drawn to the systems, cycles, and grids that drive good code. Everything has its place—like components, loops, and functions that fit together seamlessly. Think of me as a precision artist, but instead of a paintbrush, I wield JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.
